  <p>Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles that were the dominant terrestrial life form on Earth during the Mesozoic Era, about 245 million years ago. Dinosaurs went into decline near the end of the Cretaceous Period, about 66 million years ago.</p>

  <p>Although estimates vary, one of the contenders for the largest dinosaur is the Argentinosaurus. Discovered in Argentina in 1987, the Argentinosaurus is estimated to have been 37 to 40 metres (121 to 131 feet) long and weighed up to 100 metric tons.</p>
  <p>Dinosaur fossils and tracks have been discovered throughout human history. The first description of dinosaurs as a separate group of life forms (known as “Dinosauria”) was published in 1842 by British paleontologist Richard Owen, who based his findings on fossil fragments of the Cladeiodon and the Cetiosaurus.</p>
